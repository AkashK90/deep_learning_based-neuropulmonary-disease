# deep_learning_based-neiropulmonary-disease
In this project, I have applied deep learning and one transfer learning model to detect brain tumor and Pneumonia disease by the help of MRI and chest xray images.and after succesful completion we are able to reach accuracy of brain tumor opto 86% and Pneumonia 89%.

in this project for brain tumor i created neural network and for detecting PNeumonia i use prebuilt transfer learning model VGG-16, here it typically consists of 16 layers, including 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers.
